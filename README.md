## Description

Recreation with some artistic license of the original school kid's game 'The Oregon Trail'. Includes customized bad, good, and neutral events, various illnesses, landmarks, and pick your own adventure options

## My Contribution

I worked on the core functionality of the game. Creating the constructors for both the wagon and character objects. I built functions to handle events and decrement or increment character health, illness, food, money, etc. This was the first project that I really utilized my own scripts beyond basics of JQuery and JavaScript.
